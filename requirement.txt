I have an excel macro that imports data from multiple csv files and then does multiple looks ups and creates new csv files based on a set of rules. The macro works perfectly but takes a long time to run. Looking for someone to convert it Node.js using typescript. Once it is done, it is very easy to know if you have done it correctly because the output will be identical to the macro.
